# 🎬 LUTCH — where movies become shared experiences

Hi there! We’re the team behind [LUTCH](https://lutch.app), and we’re big fans of cinema.  
We created LUTCH for those who want to **do more than just watch movies** — we want to **share the experience** with friends in real time.  
You know that feeling when a movie’s not even over yet and you *already* want to talk about it? Yeah, we get it — that’s exactly why LUTCH exists.

## ✨ What can LUTCH do?

### 👀 Watch together  
Pick a movie, invite your friends — and watch **in sync**, as if you're in the same room.  
Chat while watching, react to twists, laugh or gasp together — all in just a few clicks.

### 💬 Share your impressions  
Create **stories** with your thoughts on what you've watched.  
They’ll stay on your profile for 24 hours and then be saved in the community feed, inspiring others to watch something new.

### 🔍 Discover something new  
The **Watch** tab is your window to a world of movies and series, blending official info with real user reviews.  
See something interesting? One click — and you're on the film page, ready to invite friends for a watch party.
